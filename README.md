This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-onchain`](), powered by [Urbe.Eth](https://urbe.build) and [Base](https://docs.base.org/get-started/base).

## üöÄ Ready to Code with Cursor AI

This project is fully configured for development with Cursor AI. All dependencies, smart contracts, and development environment are pre-setup and ready to use.

## AI Tooling Setup

### Cursor Configuration
To get the best AI assistance for OnchainKit development:

1. **Add OnchainKit Documentation**: 
   - Go to the Cursor chat and click on `@/Docs/+ Add new doc`
   - Paste this URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fakepixels/md-generator/refs/heads/master/combined-ock-docs-0.35.8.mdx`
   - Name it `onchainkit-docs`

2. **Add OpenZeppelin MCP Server**:
   - Visit [OpenZeppelin MCP](https://mcp.openzeppelin.com/)
   - Follow the setup guide to add the OpenZeppelin MCP server to Cursor
   - This enables AI-assisted smart contract generation using OpenZeppelin templates

3. **AI Rules**: The `.cursorrules` file contains all the rules Cursor should follow during development, including OnchainKit best practices and component patterns.

## ü§ñ Prompt Examples

Here are some effective prompts you can use with Cursor AI:

### Component Development
```
"Create a ConnectWallet component with proper error handling and loading states using OnchainKit"
```

```
"Build a transaction component that handles gas estimation and sponsorship for Base Sepolia"
```

```
"Implement an Avatar component with ENS resolution and fallback to address display"
```

### Smart Contract Integration
```
"Create a hook to interact with the Counter contract using OnchainKit's transaction components"
```

```
"Build a component that displays the current counter value and allows incrementing it"
```

### UI/UX Improvements
```
"Add a modern, responsive design to the counter interface using Tailwind CSS"
```

```
"Implement proper loading states and error boundaries for all OnchainKit components"
```

### Advanced Features
```
"Add frame metadata support for social media sharing using OnchainKit's Frame components"
```

```
"Implement a swap interface with token selection and price quotes using OnchainKit's Swap components"
```

### Debugging & Testing
```
"Help me debug this OnchainKit component that's not connecting to the wallet properly"
```

```
"Write tests for the Counter contract integration using OnchainKit components"
```
